# coding_exercise

##Usage
```
ruby app.rb file1.in file2.in ...
```

##Running tests
```
rspec
```

##Thoughts
*The sequence of jobs and its dependencies can be imagined as a graph. It's task on topological sort. I have found default TSort module but I thought that writing code would be better that using modules in scope of test. Also there are some extra validations on format which are not necessary.*

##Versions

* ruby 2.2.3
* rspec 3.4.4
